ordering of classes
arbitrary values for base classes
arbitrary variants
some variants produce more than one css thing
some variants add extra selectors (group and peer) (will have to do some heavy refactoring to handle this)
customizing from a json file:
    They will move to customizing from a css file but
    will keep backwards compatability with the json file.
    I think I will target the json file then make an adaptor that
    takes their css file and turns it into JSON for my code to understand.


tailwind features they wish they did not have:
    @apply (use theme() and spacing() instead)


my features:
- dump base classes for ide
- built in formatter for html, no need for prettier
- offline documentation
- offline repl (play.tailwind.css)
