ordering of classes - wip
arbitrary values for base classes - done
arbitrary variantsa - wip
some variants produce more than one css thing - done :(
some variants add extra selectors (group and peer) (will have to do some heavy refactoring to handle this) - barely started
customizing from a json file: - wip
    They will move to customizing from a css file but
    will keep backwards compatability with the json file.
    I think I will target the json file then make an adaptor that
    takes their css file and turns it into JSON for my code to understand.


tailwind features they wish they did not have:
    @apply (use theme() and spacing() instead)


my features:
- dump base classes for ide - seems done
- built in formatter for html, no need for prettier - kind of jank but its fine for now
- offline documentation - cli doc wip
- offline repl (like play.tailwind.css) - super easy
